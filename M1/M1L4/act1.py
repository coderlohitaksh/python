#There are five trees in Jack's front yard. He checks each tree to find out how tall it is in inches and writes the height on a sheet of paper. Jack's list: 98, 94, 41, 96, and 11. What is the average height of a tree in Jack's front yard?

# storing values of tree

t1 = 98
t2 = 94
t3 = 41
t4 = 96
t5 = 11

#Total
sum = t1 + t2 + t3 + t4 + t5 
print ("The total number of trees in cm is : " , sum)

#Average
avg = sum/5
print ("The average of the trees in cm is : " , avg)
